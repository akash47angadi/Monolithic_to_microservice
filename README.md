#Overview

This repository showcases the transformation of an e-commerce platform from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture using the MERN stack. The application was initially built as a single, unified codebase and has now been divided into four distinct, scalable microservices, each encapsulated in Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes. This enhances scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility.
